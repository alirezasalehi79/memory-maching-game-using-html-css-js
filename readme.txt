Memory Matching Game

This is a simple memory matching game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game presents a grid of cards faced down, each containing an image. The objective is to find all matching pairs by flipping two cards at a time. If the two flipped cards match, they remain visible; otherwise, they are flipped back.
